**Scene 4 (Silas and Liz):**

…

Silas: “Liz?”

Liz: “Yeah?”

Silas: “...”

Silas: “There is something I wanted to ask you.”

Liz: “Shoot.”

Silas: “In your eyes, am I… good at anything?”

Liz: “...”

Liz: “Well, it's a bit of low hanging fruit I’ll admit, but you’re easily stronger than anyone else I know.”

Liz: “And you’re pretty committed to doing well in school too. That shows determination, or at the very least some discipline.”

Silas: “...”

Silas: “Perhaps…”

Silas: “But… Working out… and studying… I do not feel any passion for these things. I just do because it is good for me.”

Liz: “...”

Silas: “And when I see the others, they all seem to have something they can do. Something they can make a life out of, you know?”

Silas: “Mindy has talent for tennis and baseball. Jonah can sing and plays the guitar very well.”

Silas: “Dani understands music too. Even if he does not play as much he could become a good music composer.” 

Silas: “Even Ange has talents. She… understands people, has a passion and a strong will. A person can do good things with these traits.”

Silas: “And then there is you. You are smarter and more rational than anyone I have ever met. No matter what seems to happen, you always find a way to make things work. If there is anyone that I am not worried about, it is you, Liz.”

Silas: “But when I think of myself…  I have none of these things that you all do.”

Silas: “Perhaps I make for a good soldier. I could join the military but…”

Silas: “...”

Silas: “Does fighting others make for a good life? What sort of purpose is that, if all I am here to do is help cause harm to someone else?”

Silas: “I think I could do it, but… I don’t know…”

Liz: “...”

Liz: “You’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, huh?”

Silas nods.

Silas: “What about you? Once you have graduated. What do you think you will do?”

Liz: “…”

Liz: “I dunno really.”

Liz: “College definitely isn’t an option, so…”

Liz: “I guess I could see myself washing cars.”

Silas: “What? Cars? Why?”

Liz shrugs.

Liz: “It’s relaxing I guess. Don’t have to think too hard about it either.”

Silas: “But… do you not have any dreams for yourself? Or ambition for more than that?”

Liz: “Nah.”

Liz: “I figured out a long time ago that reachin for the stars isn’t really my thing.”

Silas: “...”

Liz: “So long as I can afford groceries, watch TV and take care of mom, I’ll be alright.”

Silas: “And… You are sure about that?”

Liz: “Yup.”

Liz: “And it sounds to me like that’s exactly what you’re missing.”

Liz: “You know what you can do, but your heart’s not in it so it doesn’t feel fulfilling.”

Liz: “In other words, you just haven't found your thing yet.”

Silas: “Exactly. You understand.”

Silas: “This is what I wanted to ask you. How can I find what my… thing… is?”

Liz: “Heh…”

Liz: “Of all the questions you could ask, that’s the one thing I can’t answer for ya, Si.”

Liz: “If you want the answer to that,”

Liz pokes Silas in the chest.

Liz: “You gotta search in here.”

Silas: “...”

Liz: “I know, I know… it's corny as all hell. But trust me on this one. This is the sort of thing you want to come up with an answer for yourself.”

Liz: “I won’t leave you completely high and dry though.”

Liz: “A good place to start would be to think about the people and things you’ve got in your life right now.”

Liz: “If you want any of those people or things to still be around ten years from now, then think of ways you could preserve ‘em. Protect ‘em, you know?”

Liz: “Even if you don’t know what you wanna do, if you can preserve the things that make you happy then you’re already halfway to living a life that you’d be alright with.”

Silas: “...”

A soft grin spreads across Silas’ face.

Silas: “You always do know what to say.”

Liz: “It’s my talent, you said so yourself.”

Silas: “Thank you, Liz.”

Silas: “I… still need to think, but I am glad I chose to talk to you.”

Liz: “Happy to help.”
