…

Mindy: “Hello?”

Liz: “Hey.”

Mindy: “Liz! Thanks for picking up! I didn’t know if you were busy.”

Mindy: “O-Oh! Uhh… Are you busy right now?” 

Liz: “Not really, what’s up?”

Mindy: “Well, I’ve sort of been thinking recently, and well… ”

Mindy: “After… what happened, Jonah’s seemed really sad at school recently.”

Liz: “...”

Mindy: “He hasn’t really been talking much or anything… Not that he normally talks a lot, I guess…”

Mindy: “But even when he’s being quiet, he looks so sad all the time…"

Mindy: “And after school he started going straight home without even saying anything… And he hasn’t been returning my messages either…”

Liz: “I wouldn’t take it personally. People grieve in different ways, you know?”

Liz: “He probably just wants some time alone to sort himself out.”

Liz: “Once that happens, it’ll probably be a matter of time before he feels like he can open up again.”

Mindy: “...”

Mindy: “I… I guess you’re right… but-”

Liz: “But?”

Mindy: “But… I don’t know…”

Mindy: “I guess it's just hard for me to see him like that…”

Mindy: “I don’t want him to feel alone… I want him to know that I’m also here to help him through this.”

Mindy: “All of us are.”

Mindy: “Right?”

Liz: “...”

Ange: “Yo.”

Mindy: “O-Oh! Ange! You’re here too!”

Ange: “Yeah, sorry it took a minute. Had to look for my phone.”

Liz: “You lost your phone?”

Ange: “For a minute there I thought it got inside the goddam floorboards somehow. Heh.”

Ange: “But nope, just under the laundry.”

Ange: “Anyway, enough about boring ass house chores. What are you two yappin about in call? I need a distraction.”

Ange: “We planning a girls’ night or something?”

Mindy: “...”

Liz: “Not exactly. Mindy was just telling me about Jonah.”

Ange: “Jonah?”

Liz: “Yeah.”

Ange: “What about him?”

Mindy: “Well… you know how Jonah’s been kinda down recently…”

Ange: “Well, yeah, his mom died like barely two weeks ago.”

Mindy: “...”

Liz: “...”

Mindy: “W-well… I wasn’t gonna say it… _it still feels wrong to be honest…_ but yeah…”

Mindy: “You’ve probably seen how he’s been at school recently… and well… that’s why I decided to call you guys.”

Mindy: “I thought that maybe we could like, try to do something nice for him to cheer him up?”

Mindy: “Maybe… like a party?”

Ange: “A party? Heh, now you’re speaking my language!”

Ange: “I’ll cover the brownies!”

Mindy: “Ooooh! Good idea! Brownies are great!”

Liz: “_Ange_.”

Ange: “Yeeeeees?”

Liz: “You’re not feeding Jonah any ‘_brownies_’ right now of all times.”

Liz: “He needs to keep his head clear. You hear me?”

Ange: “Fiiiiiiiine.”

Ange: “Ugh…”

Liz: “Something wrong?”

Ange: “Sorta…”

Ange: “As much as I love the idea of throwing a party for our sad boi, I… kinda maybe forgot that I’m technically grounded right now.”

Mindy: “Oh.”

Liz: “Pretty sure that’s never stopped you before.”

Liz: “Actually, I’m surprised you haven’t already climbed out the window like when you were grounded the last time.”

Ange: “Well duh, obviously, but that’s exactly what I got ground for.”

Ange: “Turns out mom finally got bored enough of her reality shows to come check on me for once while I was grounded for something else, and found out I was gone.” 

Ange: “Next thing you I come home from school to find out that I’m “_double grounded_” and dad put a giant bookshelf in front of the window.”

Mindy: “Ahhhh…”

Ange: “Already tried moving it, but it makes too much noise to push without mom hearing from downstairs.”

Ange: “It seriously sucks ass. Few more weeks of this and you’re gonna find me in a straight jacket or something.”

Liz: “You’re planning to sneak out again, aren’t you?”

Ange: “Well yeah, I’m not staying here in this room all day. I’ve got shit to do.” 

Ange: “Like, I dunno, exercise? Hanging out with you guys? Seeing the sun for once?”

Ange: “Planning a kickass party.”

Liz: “...”

Ange: “Wiiiiiith absolutely no weed involved whatsoever.”

An audible sigh from Liz passes through the speaker. 

Liz: “Whatever you end up doing this time just try to be more careful about it.”

Ange: “Yes boss!”

An audible knock sounds through the phone, followed by the sound of creaking door hinges.



??: “Angela? Your father wanted me to tell you that he’s-”
??: “Hey! What’s going on in here!”
??: “Your room is still a mess! And I thought I told you no more phone until it was spotless!”


Ange: “It’s just Mindy and Liz, mom. I’m not on the phone with the cartel.”



??: “Do **not** make jokes about that, young lady!”
??: “Give me that phone. Maybe you’ll earn it back once this room is finally clean!”
??: “And I mean it! I don’t want to see a speck of dust anywhere! Do you understand me?!”



Ange: “Fine! Mom! I’ll go on and clean up the stupid room so just get off my ass already!”



??: “**ANGELA!**”

Ange: “Ahhh, whoops, gotta go!”

Ange’s sentence barely ends before she is interrupted by the sound of a disconnection.

Mindy: “...”

Mindy: “Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea…”

Liz: “Yeah… Ange sounds like she has her hands full.”

Liz: “But hey, we’ll figure something out. I’ll help you.”

Mindy: “R-Really?”

Liz: “Sure. Event planning’s never really been my thing, so I’ll leave that part up to you since it’s your idea anyway.”

Liz: “But if you need someone to help with setup, I’ll be there.”

Liz: “Plus, if you want anything from town I can grab it for you.”

Mindy: “Oh man! Really?! Thanks!”

Liz: “Don’t mention it. It’s to help a friend after all.”

Mindy: “In that case, I’ll get to planning right away! Jonah’s going to love this!”

Liz: “I’m sure he will.”

Liz: “Call me back if you need something, yeah?”

Mindy: “Okay! Bye Liz!”

Liz: “See ya.”
