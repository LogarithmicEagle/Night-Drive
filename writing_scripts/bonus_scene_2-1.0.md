Ange sighed.

She sat on the corner of his bed with a nearly unwieldy number of flash cards sandwiched in her hand. 

Dani propped himself up against the headboard, hugging his own knees which he tucked to his chest.

He ignored her second, more dramatic sigh with a patient smile.

Ange: “Do we really have to do this?”

Dani: “Hey, it’ll only be thirty minutes.”

Ange: “Yeah, thirty minutes I could have spent out getting bitches instead.”

Dani: “I’m sure you could. But you’ll have plenty of bitch-getting time later.” 

Dani: “What we _don’t_ have plenty of time for is studying for this exam.”

Ange: “I’m not even in the class.”

Dani: “Well… sure, but at least this way we get to hang out together.”

Dani: “Plus it’s bodily functions! I thought this kinda stuff would be right up your alley.”

He grinned with feigned deviousness.

Dani: “See? I put all the fun ones on top.”

Ange glanced down at the first card, squinting at it for a good few moments.

Ange: “Define ectopic pregnancy…?” 

Dani: “Oh shit, we’re starting? Okay, uh…”

Dani scrambled for his phone, missing the start timer with his thumb a few times before finally finding it. 

Dani: “It’s the development of a fertile egg in the-“

Ange: “Nope! Looks like the right answer was…”

She flipped the card.

Ange: “…Nightmare scenario!” 

Ange: “You were close though!!”

Dani: “Ange, come on…!”

Ange: “Dani, if you could name a single card in here that you don’t already know like the back of your hand I might take this seriously.”

Dani: “Would you?”

She shrugged, then grinned.

Ange: “No. 

Ange: "Out of everyone you could have chosen, why did you really pick me for something like this?"

Dani: “Because you’re my best friend!” 

Dani: “And Jonah’s on that family trip.”

Ange: “You know, Daniboy, you really do know how to make a girl feel special.”

Dani: “He’s different though!”

Dani: “And besides, you got here _real_ quick, which doesn’t make much sense for someone who’s _so_ opposed to studying_._”

Dani smirked at her, but Ange seemed unphased. He tried his best to suppress his sigh, watching as Ange absentmindedly ran a claw through the fur on her leg.

Ange: “Yeah, well sue me for wanting to make up for lost time.”

Ange: “I was going to invite you over like… _decades_ ago, but my mom is apparently competing for the world’s most boring tradwife award and still barely leaves home.”

Ange: “And It’s not like technically being grounded helps.”

Ange: “But, luckily for me, mom and dad are out on a date tonight, and chances like this don’t come around super often.”

Suddenly she paused, lifting her head back up to meet Dani and raising a curious brow at him.

The accompanying mischievous smile she now wore unnerved him.

Ange: “You know, speaking of chances, I actually have a little working theory.”

Dani: “And what is that?”

Ange: “What’s the saying?”

Ange: “Theories aren’t shit until you try ‘em?”

Dani: “What…?”

Dani: “I don’t even know what saying you’re _deriving_ that from.”

Ange set the cards down on the ground, half of the pile sliding in an avalanche down one another.

Ange: "Luckily for me, I don't need a fancy degree or a lab in order to test this one."

Dani rolled his eyes playfully, letting his legs lie flat on the bed. 

Dani: “Ange, what the fuck are you talking about?”

Ange slid off the bed and stretched, arching her back and raising her arms above her head.

Ange: "Oh you just sit tight, I'll get to that."

Dani: "..."

Dani couldn’t help but stretch himself, but he kept his eyes on Ange as she strode to the door of the room.

Ange: "But in summary, I think it's time I did some science of my own."

Dani: “If it’s something I’ll be held accountable for if questioned by police, then no.”

Ange: “Nah.” 

Ange stopped at the door, turning the small lock with a click, causing Dani’s smile to stall. 

.

Dani: “Uh… Ange? The fuck are you doing?”

Ange: “An experiment.”

Dani: “What, how much blood I can lose before passing out? The fuck are you locking the door for?”

He knew though. 

She had made a comment that only his car was in the driveway earlier that evening- noting that his mother wasn’t home. 

She was off at work, he was sure, for another 4 or so hours with traffic.

And Ange had quite the history of… _shenanigans_. 

His heartbeat quickened and it felt as if the air in the room had thinned slightly. 

Ange: “Oh no, don’t worry. Hell, you might even enjoy this.”

Dani: “Ange, whatever ‘this’ is, I have a feeling that-”

He trailed off as she appeared next to him again with the same puckish grin as before smeared across her face. 

She planted a knee on the bed and swung a leg over him, straddling him as Dani’s lungs caught in his ribs, his heart hammering into his chest. 

Dani: “I-I thought you…” 

He swallowed again. 

Dani: “I thought you had a thing for Silas.”

Ange: “Oh he’s great, but he’s more of a one and done sorta deal, you know?”

Dani: “O-One and…?”

It felt nearly impossible to speak, and when he did, his voice was barely above a squeak.

Her hands stretched down to his chest and she leaned in, pressed her mouth to Dani’s beak. 

She held for a moment but didn’t push further- their lips simply sat stagnant for a moment. 

She pulled back with gold-amber eyes that drilled into Dani’s. He could feel her press into him slightly, letting her breath fall hot into his cheek.

Her hands dropped slightly, then wrapped around his midsection and gripped his back.

She slid her muzzle to the side, pushed further to his ear, and began to whisper. 

Ange: “Wanna fuck?”

It felt as if his face combusted, all the blood draining from it leaving nothing but a cold resonance in its wake.

Ange pulled back for a moment and examined him, most likely due to his lack of a response. He must look mortified, he knew- and he assumed that’s why her smile widened.

Ange: “Mmmmmhm.”

Ange suddenly swung her leg back over Dani, rolling to his side as she sat next to him and leaned against the bed’s headboard.

A nicotine rig materialized in her hand and she was already blowing out vapor- though it was entirely possible that Dani missed her pulling it out through the shocked glazed-over stare as the past several minutes began registering in his mind.

Ange: “So you said that Jonah was different earlier, what did you mean by that?”

Dani: “Wh-What the fuck just happened?”

His voice was barely a squeak.

Ange: “Oh. Right.” 

She took another long drag from her rig, spoke through blowing it out.

Ange: “An experiment, kinda.”

Ange: “Either I was right, or we’d fuck… so I win either way.”

Ange: "Practical exam's over though. It's time for the verbal exam now."

Ange: "So, what exactly is Jonah to you?"

Dani might have lied if he had fully recuperated from his shock. 

As his mind processed the question, he realized he had been staring at Ange’s tail as it flicked back and forth behind her.

Dani: “I don’t know.”

Dani: “I mea-”

Ange: "Dani, this is one of the only times I'm going to be serious about this."

Ange: "So if there's something you wanna get off your chest, now's the time."

Dani scraped his mind for a response, a cool, casual dismissal to wave whatever she was about to say away- but of course, nothing came.

Nothing ever did.

Ange: “Look, I know I’m... a lot sometimes. But you can always talk to me, alright?"

Ange: “And… I’m not saying you’re obligated_ _to tell me anything…”

 

Ange: “But… I…”

 

Ange: “Fuck, you know I’m not good at this type of thing.”

Ange: “I guess what I’m trying to say is that you’re my best friend. Seriously. So… if there’s anything you need to work out, I’m here for it.”

She paused. 

Ange: “Fuck that was long.” 

Another drag from her rig. 

Ange: “Oh. Right.”

 

Ange: “Also if you need any tips or pointers on coming out, I’ve been through that whole song and dance so…”

Dani chuckled, though he didn’t fully grasp the entire meaning of her addendum, wiping at his eyes and leaving a trail of fresh damp streaks behind on his arm. 

Out of all of the people to give him a talk like that, he thought Ange would be the last. But still, here they were, and it meant everything to Dani; it was all the reassurance he would ever need.

Dani: “You’ve got me all figured out, huh?”

She glanced at him, looked ahead, double-took back to him with an exasperated anger worn comically. 

Ange: “Oh sweet Mother Fahrin and the holy Shepard, were you fucking crying?!?” 

She slapped his arm playfully as she enunciated over each word as more and more of her smile broke through her angered facade.

By the end of her barrage of petty slaps, Dani began to make an effort to duck and bob out of the way until the both of them were giggling breathlessly.

Dani: “Do you mind if I try?”

Dani’s eyes gestured to the rig she held casually in her paw, and Ae followed his gaze down to the rig as well, then back up to meet him with her signature sly grin. 

Ange: “Ahaha! I fucking corrupted you! Took long enough!”

She made a flourish with the massive rig as she passed it to him, tossing it into the air, tapping it at the top spinning the opposite way- then catching it again in the same hand.

Dani: “Showoff.”

Ange: “Bitch, you know it. Take it slow though.”

Dani was already taking in a drag- that would be if the vapor didn’t turn to steel wool in his lungs and cause his body to immediately reject it in a fit of coughs. 

The thin cloud that had accumulated in his lungs suddenly erupted out from his mouth and nose simultaneously, causing Ange to snicker. 

Ange: “Careful there cowboy. You’re gonna give yourself a hernia or something.”

Dani: “Yeah I… don’t think it’s for me.”

Ange: “It’s not for everybody, but that’s one off the bucket list, right?”

Dani nods, passing the rig back to her and Ange takes another puff in approval. 

Ange: “So was I right about Jonah and you?”

Dani: “Ah, nuh-uh, I get to ask a question now.”

Ange: “...”

Ange shrugs. 

Ange: “Fair enough.”

He was surprised that worked! He fumbled for a moment before finally asking,

Dani: “What about you and Silas? Is there… anything going on there…?”

Ange: “…”

Ange: “I wish.”

Ange: “Before a while ago I thought that fucker was the most aero-ace person to ever exist, **ever.**”

Ange: “Which would have been a total shame, I mean take a look at those damn muscles. You could chop fuckin steaks on those abs…”

Ange’s voice trails off for a moment before she suddenly seems to refocus as she giggles to herself.

Ange: “Although, It seems to me like he’s mostly ace… with a few exceptions… sometimes. He’s definitely not the romantic type though, that’s for sure.”

Ange: “Like I said. It was probably a one-and done sorta thing… buuuuuuuut… if it does happen again, fuck yeah, he had a pornsta-”

Dani: “Okay, yeah I… you told me that part already.” 

Dani: “But… uh… what was with-”

Ange interrupted. 

Ange: “Nope. My turn.”

Dani: “Oh, sure, yeah.”

Ange: “So, same question as before. You and Jonah…?”

Dani: “I…”

Dani thought for a moment, and as he realized he didn’t have an exact answer, he simply began to think out loud.

Dani: “I don’t know. I don’t know if… what I’ve been feeling is a crush or… I…”

He fumbled with his hands, not noticing how intently Ange was studying him. 

Dani: “I don’t know if he’s just a really good friend or… something else.”

Ange: “Earlier though. You said he was different.”

Dani: “I guess he is. Yeah. I don’t know how but it’s just this feeling that I get sometimes. 

“When he’s around or… if I’m thinking about him-”

Dani: “And I know I’m not making any points for myself on the ‘it might just be nothing’ thing here, I think about you too, don’t get me wrong- but it’s this…”

Dani: “This _weight_, in my chest. And it’s like I can’t get enough air, and I get this… feeling…”

Ange: “Like if you could have only one thing, it would be to be there with them.”

Ange finished quietly, her eyes gazing almost sullenly at her legs.

Dani looked at her, his mouth still open slightly, somewhat taken aback. 

_Was this about Silas…?_

Dani: “Yeah. I… I guess that’s the best way to put it.”

Ange nodded in response, grinning suddenly. 

Ange: “And you want to fuck him?”

Dani choked on the spit he had in his mouth as he suppressed a gasp and crumpled into a fit of violent coughing. Before he was even finished, he looked at her with bugged eyes.

Dani: “WHAT?!”

His entire head burned so hot with embarrassment he felt like she could likely feel it next to him.

Ange: “Guess it’s fair to answer your question now- about the experiment.”

 

Ange: “You have a 10/10 bad bitch-”

Ange: “That’s me by the way, hi- Literally on top of you and asking if you want to fuck, and you didn’t immediately start stripping.”

Ange: “Which means… You’re not into bad bitches!”

Ange: “Just… quiet little wolf dudes.”

Dani: “I- wh- I just was in shock! I may have been getting to that in a second!”

He realized how much he sounded like he was coping only after he had said it. In response, she scoffed at him teasingly.

Ange: “Daniboy, If you were ‘_about to get to it_’,’ I would have felt it.”

Dani: “What do-”

When the realization struck him, it was all he could do to not choke on his spit again. It was even worse when he realized she was doing everything she could not to burst out laughing.

Ange: "Hey believe me, I totally getcha, dudes are hot!"

Dani: “I…”

 

Dani: “WHAT…”

Dani: “MAYBE I WAS JUST…”

 

Dani: “FUCK YOU, I WAS NERVOUS!”

The laughter which Ange had been trying so desperately to hold back finally burst through her lips.

Ange: “That might have actually been a valid argument if you didn’t say it like _that_!”

Dani: “LIKE WHAT?!”

Her laughter boiled again. 

Ange: “LIKE _THAT_! Oh my gosh Dani- It’s almost adorable how oblivious you can be sometimes…”

 

It sounded like she was going to say more, but her laughter completely overwhelmed her throat.

Somehow, Dani felt himself smiling too- almost laughing. 

He looked around, then finally shrugged.

Dani: “Yeah… I guess guys are pretty hot, huh?”

At that, Ange's bout of laughter seemed to subside enough to allow her to form sentences again.

Ange: “And girls?”

Dani: “They’re… easier to talk to.”

Ange: “See and that’s how I know you’re gay.”

Dani: “Fuck you I’m right!”

Ange: “No you are! That’s how I know you’re gay!”

Ange: "Any guy with a shred of libido would jump at the chance to at least be friends with benefits with whoever they're attracted to."

Ange: "Like, name one straight guy who's best friends with a girl and isn't secretly trying to sleep with her?"

Dani: “Jonah. And Mindy.”

Ange blinked at him.

Ange: “Okay first off- that was a quick response.”

 

Ange: “Is that jealousy I hear?”

After Dani struggled for words for several moments, Ange continued. 

Ange: “We’ll get back to that. You’re saying _Jonah’s _straight?”

Dani: “I mean… yeah? Did he say…?”

Ange: “Ooooooh biiiiiitch, he doesn’t _need_ to say.”

Ange: “Dani, he’s a quiet bass player with a good taste in music and uses scented gels on his fur; if that doesn’t even smell a _little _like fruit to you then you need to grab a shovel and dig your own head out of your ass.”

Dani: “Just because he likes music and puts some effort into his appearance doesn’t mean he likes guys.”

Ange: “Daniboy, he cuffs his jeans and _literally_ smells like citrus.”

Dani shook his head, but a seed of hope struggled from inside him. Everything thought he had boiling in his mind argued his own logic- 

But still, that small instampable weed of something else buried itself within him.

Ange: “And besides that, you think he really likes Mindy like _that_?”

The hope wilted slightly.

Dani: “I… I mean he’s constantly with her.”

Ange: “When he’s not with you maybe.” 

Dani furrowed his brow at her.

Ange: "What? You think I'm screwing with you?"

Ange: "Heh, you must be even more oblivious than you look."

Dani: "What's that supposed to mean?"

Ange: "Let me put it this way."

Ange: "Sure, Jonah hangs out with Mindy sometimes. Aaaaaand do I need to remind you of how many movie marathon nights the two of you have had?"

Ange: "Or the hours on end you spend playing video games? Or those board games or whatever that the two of you never shut up about?"

Dani: “He doesn’t show me any of his music.”

His eyes sagged down as he pulled the bed sheets up to his stomach.

Ange: “_What?_”

Dani couldn’t tell if the question was hyperbolic.

Dani: “His music. His bass stuff. I mean… that’s like… _his thing,_ y’know?”

 

Dani: “He writes music, and Mindy being Mindy always tries to tell me how good it is, and how his songs always mean ‘so much to her’”

He spoke with a venomous bite without realizing.

Dani: “A-and I ask if he’s working on a song and he just says ‘yeah’, and when I ask if I can hear he always just says ‘it’s not done yet’ or some other bullshit excuse-”

 

Dani: “Even though this is _after _Mindy would just say how sweet the song was, which means he fucking already played it for her!”

Dani: “The one thing he actually _creates, _the thing that he puts _himself_ into…”

 

Ani: “And it’s for her.”

Dani stared down at his hands, viced onto his thighs. When he finally noticed and loosened his grip, suddenly disappointed in himself. 

_How pitiful he must sound…_

His head fell back as he sighed.

Ange: “Hey fuckwit.”

A twinge of frustration flared in Dani, he could feel his jaw set slightly.

Ange: “Have you actually heard **_any_** of his songs?”

Dani: “Ange- did you even hear a single word I just s-”

Ange: “Like half of them are love songs dude!”

Dani: “So?”

Something about this stunted Dani’s heart. His voice slipped slightly- it was softer than he meant it to be. It sounded more curious than spiteful_._

Ange: “So, even I’ve heard ‘em.”

 

Ange: “Think about it.”

Ange: “A guy writes love songs about quietly watching from the background as whoever it's about lives their great life, and he’s just happy to be a part of it- classic Midwest emo shit, right?”

 

Ange: “And he sings it to Mindy- and he sings it to me, and probably Liz, and maybe even Silas.”

 

Ange: “But when it comes to you he can’t bring himself to do it.”

Ange: “I’m just saying, one of these things is not like the other.” 

She takes a longer hit from her rig attempting to blow it out in rings, the vapor quickly pulled out of shape by the overhead fan as Dani thought, stewing in the silence. 

Dani: “You… really think that’s the reason why?”

Ange: “I’ll wait for you to give me another one.”

…

…

Dani: “Well… I guess maybe when he gets back from his trip I could…”

His voice trailed off as he searched for words, but the growing smirk on Ange’s face jolted him back into focus.

Dani: “Y-yeah, when he gets back I’ll find a way to tell him. Probably good to catch him while he’s riding the high from his trip.”

Dani: “What’s the worst that could happen, right?”

Ange: “Aaaaahahaaaa! That’s my boy!”
