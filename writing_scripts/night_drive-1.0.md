His phone was dialing, but he couldn’t hear it over the roar of his car’s engine. His eyes swept for cars, but it was too late for any traffic. 

He glanced down at his fuel gauge before he checked his speedometer. A quarter of a tank. Good. 

Only then did his eyes glance at the needle, slowly creeping further and further round the display. 92, 95, 98… 

It took him around 15 minutes to get to Jonah’s house going around 50, going 100 should half the time. 

He glanced down to his phone. How long ago was the text sent…?

He glanced up at the road again, approaching a curve. He wheeled around it, the force shifting his body against the middle console, the week-old water in the bottle sitting in his cup-holder sloping up the side of its container with the curve. 

His phone sitting in the passenger seat slowly slid away from him, nearly toppling over the edge of the seat to the door. 

Dani’s hand shot down to catch it, swerving slightly, causing his wheels to squeal out in protest. The end of the curve came and his wheels realigned behind him. He didn’t notice the dial end, his heartbeat now even louder than the engine rattling in its frame. 

Streetlights on either flank streaked to and from his view in arcs.

Fuck, should he call Liz? Maybe Silas? 

He pressed “call” again, not looking down to his phone. The light up ahead turned yellow, red. He glanced to either side of the intersection, no one there. 

Right! When was the text sent? He opened his messaging app as his car blasts past a red light. 

Jonah, 12:25. 

He glanced at the time. 12:34. 

_Shit_. 

He glanced up again, passed a car in the left lane who he knew was honking at him. He didn’t see red and blue lights flash, his foot pressed further into the gas. 

Eyes down again. 105… 108, slowly creeping further. Construction cones streaked past his car. 

He was getting close now, a mile or two more, maybe three. The phone dials out again. 

Dani: “_FUCK, JONAH!_” 

He said it out loud, to himself, to Jonah, to anyone else who may have gotten the same text he did.


### Jonah (Silly little man)

12:25

Hey

Sorry for sending this so late

I just thought I would let you know that I don’t

think I’m going to be around much longer

Maybe we’ll meet each other again sometime

If the others ask, tell them I’ll miss them

He finally eased on the gas, he’s getting closer. _111, 107, 99._ Once more to his phone. 

12:36. 

The turn is coming up. Into the neighborhood, just down the street, a few turns, and he’s there. 

The light ahead is green this time. He swerved around the corner, he felt the back half of his car swinging behind him, the wheels screeching, his gears cranking down, down again, down again. 

The ass end of his car swung full around, facing him back the way he came as he stopped in the intersection. He pressed the gas again, wheel turned, and the back end of his car swung back around in the right direction. Past the gas- 

_holy fuck._

He slammed on his brakes, nearly losing control of the car again. He pulled into the gas station, his heart hammering in his ears, numb in his feet and fingers. 

There sat Jonah, against the dark wall of the gas station, balled on the ground, back against the wall. 

Dani wouldn’t have noticed him if it wasn’t for the scuffed blue jeans and the gray “Encyclopedic Trouble” hoodie he always wore. 

Dani swung into a parking spot just across the lot and threw the car into park, stepping out without bothering to cut the engine. 

He half-jogged to Jonah, who hadn’t moved in the slightest, his arm over his knees and his head tucked down into the recess it made. 

Dani’s breath was ragged now that he had found Jonah… he wasn’t too late.

Dani: “Hey,” 

He saw Jonah jump, shuddering as the wolf’s head shot upright to look back at him. 

His eyes were wide and bloodshot, drying tears had dug trenches through the fur on his cheeks. 

He buried his face in his sleeve, rubbing the tears out of his eyes. When he looked back up at Dani, his ears had seemingly relaxed and he now wore a shaky smile.

Jonah: “H-Hey, Dani,” 

The words coming from him sounded choked and strained, then another faint whimpering sound as he tried to rub the tears from his eyes again. 

Jonah: “You’re… o-out pretty late.”

Dani: “Yeah. I uhhh… I got your message…” 

Dani tried to offer as reassuring a smile he could, but his eyes scanned Jonah up and down, searching for blood, a knife, a razor- anything. 

From what he could tell, the wolf’s hands were empty though, sleeves unstained, and a gray plastic bag sitting next to him. “Thank you! :)” in yellow text.

Jonah: “Oh…”

Jonah glanced away for a moment, breaking eye contact 

Jonah: “Sorry about that.” 

Jonah: “I was just…”

Jonah: “...”

The last word stopped abruptly, like it caught in the back of his throat as it stretched from his mind.

 

Jonah swallowed the knot of words back down and Dani waits; he waits until he realizes Jonah isn’t going to finish. 

Dani: “Hey, its okay.”

Dani’s voice was weaker than he wanted it to sound- more timid. 

He cleared his throat a little in an attempt to readjust and sound more casual. He opened his mouth to speak… but the words got caught in his throat just the same as Jonah. 

If this was as bad as he thought it might be, words alone were not going to be enough. 

Dani: “Can I?” 

He gestured slowly to an empty spot on the wall just next to Jonah. 

The wolf glanced back up, following Dani’s gaze to the wall, and the nod he responded with was so subtle and slow that Dani almost missed it. 

Dani’s body felt stiff as he started walking to approach the wall again, like somehow it was no longer fully his own- he shuffled slowly forward, knees locked and head down. 

In that moment Dani would have given anything to wake up and find that this all had been nothing but a vivid nightmare. 

Dani’s back slid down against the wall, stopping in a sitting position just beside his friend, one leg stretched out into the lot and the other hiked up into his stomach. 

He glanced down at his shoes, then to Jonah, then to the streetlight he parked underneath- anything. 

_His mind was still racing_, he realized. 

He leaned his head back, closed his eyes, drew a deep breath. He steadied his heart, holding his breath for a moment. 

He let it out, drew one more… and as he did… time slowed again.  

He could hear the breeze through the grass again, crickets chirping in the empty lot between the gas station and Jonah’s neighborhood, his mind finally able to restabilize, to refocus. 

Okay. 

He made it. 

That was the first step. He didn’t think much past this point if he was being honest to himself, he figured he would show up and find…

Maybe we’ll meet each other again sometime

When he got the text it was all he could think about- Jonah in some red stained bathtub, or in some closet next to a knocked over stool- 

Dani shook his head, pushing the grim thought from his mind. 

He was here now. Right next to him. 

He could… what could he do?

Jonah: “You got here fast.”

Dani: “Oh… yeah.” 

Dani chuckled as he swore he felt an updraft of heat coming from beneath him. He glanced back at his hiked knee, studying the hole in his jeans. 

Dani: “I’m actually kinda surprised my car didn’t fuckin’… explode or something.” 

Jonah: “…”

Dani: “You know, you really scared the shit out of me,” 

Dani chuckled nervously. He glanced up, still holding the faux smile- but it fell when he saw how hurt Jonah looked by it. 

Dani: “No it’s… I don’t mind. Or… I mean…”

Jonah: “I know.”

Jonah: “...”

Jonah: “I’m sorry…”

His voice was soft and cracked. Dani paused for a few moments. Not knowing what else to do, he stood and offered his hand down. 

Dani: “C’mon.”

Jonah: “Hmmm?”

Dani: “Oh, well, the ground here isn’t exactly super comfortable. I just thought maybe we could go sit in the car or something.”

Jonah looked up at him as if deciding something, and after a moment, he reached up to take Dani by the hand, pulling himself onto his feet. 

It took almost all of Dani’s restraint to not sigh out with relief. 

He offered a smile to the wolf, but Jonah’s eyes were trained on the ground as he rubbed one of his elbows in his hands nervously. 

Dani then noticed the bag on the ground- Jonah hadn’t picked it up when he stood. 

Dani: “Oh! Don’t forget your bag,” 

Dani: “Here, I’ll get it for you.”

Jonah: “N-no, wait-” 

Dani had already swooped down and snagged the bag by one of the handles. He was about to curse as the contents toppled onto concrete, but he froze once he realized what it was.

Beneath him was a coiled spool of hempen rope. Some loose change with a total value that Dani failed to identify in the moment clattered against the ground beside it. 

Dani turned his head to the wolf, and as he did, Jonah visibly flinched away. 

…

Again, that terrible, suffocating silence.

Dani slowly crouched down, sweeping his hand across the ground for the scattered coins. 

Dani: “Four dimes…” 

Dani: “A quarter… shit wait no that’s a nickel. Five… or no, four pennies…” 

After counting the change, he stood up slowly and turned to face Jonah, presenting the spilled coins in his outstretched palm. 

Dani’s voice tremored as he spoke.

Dani: “I… saw the price tag.” 

Dani: “I-It was 12.50, right? I counted 49 cents here so… I think we’re missing a penny if you can live with that...”

Suddenly, Dani lunged forward, clutching the change in his hand as he wrapped his arms around his friend. 

He could feel Jonah flinch back at first, but he settled, leaning back into Dani’s embrace.

Dani: “Let’s go back to the car… please?”

Jonah: “...Okay.” 

___________________________________________

The two sat in silence in Dani’s car as the gentle hum and vibration of the car’s engine droned on between them.  

Dani: “Do you want anything while we’re here?” 

Dani: “I could get… like… a… slushy…?”

Jonah: “I’m alright… Thanks.”

Dani: “Here I’ve… got some water…”

He glanced down at the half-empty bottle in the cup-holder. 

Dani: “I’ve also got more in the back. Or… you could just finish this one if you wanted it. Not sure…”  

Jonah: “I’m fine.”

Jonah: “Really though… thanks,”

…

Dani: “So… do you… like… want to go back to your house?”

Dani: “I don’t mind spending the night, I don’t have work tomorrow,” 

He lied- though it was now true. 

Although, as he glanced over to the passenger side again, he noticed Jonah’s expression, shoulders hunched, ears flattened as his head shook. 

Dani: “Oh…! I uh… Okay… uh…”

Dani: “How about… we could… go for a drive?” 

Jonah: “A drive?” 

One of Jonah’s ears twitched.

Dani: “Yeah! I’ve… got nothing else to do, plus I mean I get to spend some time with…”

Dani paused for a long moment, another warm draft pushing through his closed window. 

Dani: “I wasn’t doing anything,” 

He cleared his throat, marginally more subtle than if a brick fell through the windshield. 

Dani: “I-I mean think it might be good to hang out for a bit… or something.” 

Jonah exhales as the ends of his muzzle briefly curl into the shape of a smile.

Jonah: “Sure. I don’t mind, I guess.”

Dani: “R-Really?” 

Dani: “...”

Dani: ”I mean, yeah, great!”

He glanced down at his phone and swiped it open, smiling to himself with the idea he had suddenly formed as he opened “Musely” on his phone. 

He knew Jonah’s taste in music pretty well and even had a playlist of bands and songs he’d made for the wolf when he bought him headphones for his last birthday. 

Within moments, “Back Alley Wallflower” began to blast over the speakers, causing the both of them to jump at the sudden bassy drums. 

Dani’s hand flew to the volume knob and cranked it down a little too much, so he set it at a _reasonably _loud volume- at least loud enough to drown out whatever thoughts might still be swimming around in the wolf’s head.

Dani looked to Jonah with a showman’s smile, half hoping for a reflected beaming smile. But Jonah’s face was flat and placid, his stony eyes half glazed over as if he didn’t recognize the song in the slightest. 

_Wait,_ Dani thought as he finally put the car into reverse. _This was his favorite song, right?_

He was… yes, he was _sure_ it was this one- he had gone on rants about how well the “progression resolved”... or something.

He glanced over, and even as he turned out of the parking lot his eyes remained stagnant inspecting the seams of the glovebox. 

Dani turned out of the parking lot and as he looked to his right, Jonah seemed to blink back to reality- but something wasn’t quite right. 

His face was still sunken and lost. As the two made eye contact, the wolf’s expression shifted into an unassuming smile that did not reach his eyes.

The sight terrified Dani. 

Of course, Jonah had been lost in his own head before, and of course he would eventually merge back to his surroundings. 

But not like this. 

Even now, with the same smile he always wore when he returned, his eyes were like he was already dead. 

Dani turned, breaking eye contact and returning a smile- though he wasn’t sure if it looked like it. Forced and tight, it felt wrong on his face. 

It felt as if his ribs had shrunk and expanded down, his stomach pressed into a tight ball and his chest heavy and suffocated.

Dani: “Oh…! If I’m remembering right, you told me you were starting to work on a new song, right? How’s that been going?” 

He surprised himself at how loose his tone was, how _unaware _it sounded.

Jonah: “It’s… alright…” 

Dani nodded, turning his head toward Jonah, keeping his eyes on the road. 

Dani: “Yeah, that’s good! That’s… good…”

Dani: “Y’know, uh, Ange is pretty good at singing!”

Dani: “Or… at least _I_ think so anyway- if it’s grunge… or something… and also I've been learning in my freetime to play piano, which is _basically_ just synth.”

Dani: “I bet if we could find like… a drummer or something? Maybe Silas? He has that… pent up rage vibe that most drum guys have, right?”

Dani: “I think we’d make a pretty kickass band.”

He glanced at Jonah, only taking in his incredulous look for a split second. 

Dani: “Hold on, hear me out! Me, you, Ange, maybe Silas, and then maybe we could get one of the others on, like, I don’t know… bells… or something?” 

He heard Jonah snort sharply beside him at the proposition, and decided to follow up with a playful nudge of his elbow. 

His face lit up as he saw the beginning of a genuine smile begin to gather on the wolf’s face. 

Dani: “Come oooon! Tell me it’s not a great idea! I really think I might be onto something here!”

Jonah: “No, it's just… the thought of Ange singing.” 

The wolf chuckled, genuinely this time. 

Jonah: “I don’t think that’s something the world is ready for.” 

Dani glanced at Jonah, just the reflection of life back in the wolf’s eyes made all the difference to Dani. He nudged Jonah’s arm again, his smile wide and real. 

Dani: “So what I’m hearing is that we’ve got something unique! Isn’t that kinda stuff exactly what you need to make it in music?” 

Jonah: “Well sure, but you have to sound good too.”

Dani: “With our _incredible_ talent and _unparalleled _potential, that shouldn’t be too hard after some practice!”

Dani: “We could spend some time practicing to nail down that vibe and then from there we could start small, garage band type stuff.”

Dani: “We could start with local places- not sure where- and watching the crowd go from, like, just our parents to like a restaurant or something, a bar with a little stage, start building a presence? Start like a social medi-”

As he realized, it felt as if his chest hollowed and collapsed all at once, the content of his stomach lifting weightless within it.

**_Our parents, you dumbass!?!_**

He gripped the steering wheel tight with both hands, head and eyes both unilaterally forward. The last of his smile died near instantly. 

He didn’t look at Jonah. He didn’t think he could. 

Dani: “I’m sorry.”

Jonah: “It’s okay.” 

…

…

Up ahead Dani noticed the back of a large sign that indicated they were approaching the edge of town.

_______________________________________________________________________

**Decision: **

Take Jonah to your ‘spot’ - 

Take the road out of town - 

______________________________________________________________

**ENDING = Take Jonah to your ‘spot’ **

Dani pulled off of the road a ways out of town, down a little packed dirt trail parting the trees which hung in a canopy over the path. 

He had recovered somewhat from the last conversation, though a chill still hung in the car- though not between them. 

It was a dull, creeping cold that nipped at the back of his neck, tendriled through his lungs like frost, ached at his fingers like clamps; but it was by no means an impediment to either of them- rather it seemed an invitation to break the mood. 

But still, no words came to Dani no matter how far inside his mind he scraped for topics. 

That’s how he came to think “Don’t worry, I’m not kidnapping you” …Was a good joke to make at the moment. 

Dani glanced over to Jonah, who once again didn’t seem to notice that Dani had said anything at all. 

Dani: “Hey, so uh… how…?” 

Dani paused for a moment, mouth open and breath held. 

Dani: “What do you think?” 

He gestured out in front of him, waving a hand to emphasize the beauty of this pitch black forest. 

He saw Jonah look absently at him from his peripheral. 

Jonah: “Hmm?”

Dani: “What do you think?” 

Jonah: “Of… the forest?”

Dani: “Well… yeah!”

Dani: “I mean we have like… a minute more to go but what do you think?”

Dani slowed so he could gauge Jonah’s reaction. He simply stared at him, the cogs in his head clearly trying to mash together a reasonable answer for such a question- which he didn’t know was _exactly_ the point. 

Jonah: “It’s… nice…? I guess? It’s secluded. And quiet.”

Dani: “Right?”

He could _feel_ Jonah’s scanning eyes, glancing him up and down wondering what any of this conversation meant, like perhaps he missed some context- though surprisingly to Dani, it seemed Jonah came to a realization and glanced down at his lap in deep contemplation. 

Only a dozen or so seconds passed before the path widened slightly into a circle of trampled brush and weeds. 

Dani wheeled his car around so it could face the road once more, then cut the ignition. It sputtered, then silenced. 

Total silence invaded from the outside, spare a rogue bird’s song or a desolate cicada’s croak.

Dani: “We’ll have to walk the rest of the way but it’s not far. It is kinda out of the way though- at least in terms of the main road- so watch out for ticks and whatnot.”

Dani: “Know what? Actually, I think I’ve got some bug spray in the back… hold on.”

Dani twisted in his seat using the passenger side headrest as leverage. 

Dani: “Yep! Hold on, it’s in the corner on the floor. Think I braked too hard earlier.” 

He unclicked his seatbelt and guided it back to its place against the door, then leaned and grappled for the spray can. 

Dani: “Oh… hold on.”

He pressed his feet into the floor, pushing himself out of the seat slightly. He propped his ribs on the middle console and reached further- the tip of his finger just grazed it. 

Dani: “C’mon...”

Jonah: “Do you-”

Dani: “No no I got it, don’t worry.”

Dani contorted further pushing from his seat and twisting around the full corner. His bottom rib slipped off of the console and he was gutted by it. 

He reached for the middle of the can but it rotated from his grasp, now unable to breathe.

Dani: “_Shit. I… I’ve got it. Hold on.” _

He wriggled slightly, further round the corner. 

He was now nearly completely free of his seat and balancing entirely on the console, feet off the ground and the edge digging into his hip until he eventually wrapped his hand around the can and lifted. 

Dani: “FINA-” 

He was interrupted by the tipping of his face into the back-seat’s carpeting, his shoes hitting the steering wheel. 

The rest was an awkward, slow slide as gravity overtook him, the hand he had been using to stabilize himself now holding a half-empty aerosol of bug repellent. 

He could already imagine the bruising down his right side. 

The back seat door- which his head was now next to as he laid face down on the floorboard- opened. Slowly, the can was freed from his grasp and he glanced up, still trying to catch up on his breath.

Jonah: “Thanks. The back route’s a bit less effort though.” 

Dani: “Yep…” 

Dani groaned.

He shimmied through the open door, planted his fingers in the soft soil, and kicked his way from the car, spinning onto his feet. 

Dani: “Right. Spray me.”

Jonah: “...”

Dani: “What? Why are you looking at me like that?”

Dani squinted, cracking his beak slightly ajar. His eyes glanced down to the can in Jonah’s hand. Jonah’s eyes followed- then his face lightened, stretching, then forming back into itself. 

Jonah: “Oh. Right.”

Dani gave him one last sour glance before turning around and holding his arms out. 

Jonah: “H-Hey, I’m not lying. I have relatives who will piss on stuff on command…” 

Dani: “Just spr- _apply_ it.”

Jonah did so, sweeping back and forth with the chemical mist, the sound of the spray deafening in the near silence. 

He hadn’t ever noticed the blatant… emptiness of the woods on any of his other trips here- though he supposes maybe he just wasn’t paying it much mind before.

Dani: “Alright. Let me get you done,” 

He took the can and did the same, spraying Jonah’s back, then spraying his own front, then Jonah’s. 

Dani: “Alright! Perfect,” 

Dani: “Now… the fun part.”

Jonah: “Dani… I…”

Dani: “Oh! Yeah?”

Jonah: “I don’t know. Is this… really worth it?”

Dani: “This spot? Yeah, I mean… I come out here like every other week. Like I said, I think you’re going to lo-”

Jonah: “That’s not what I meant,” 

Dani stopped fishing the phone out of his pocket for a moment to turn and look at him. 

Jonah took a long breath, then continued, a hand wrapped around the opposite elbow. 

Jonah: “I mean… doing all this for me. I’m not worth the trouble of all… this. And I’m…”

He sputtered for a moment.

Jonah: “I’m happy you took the time to drive me all the way out here so you could show this… ‘secret spot’,”

Jonah flicked his hand to punctuate, staring at the ground. After a moment, he dropped it to his side and he seemed to deflate. 

Jonah: “But you’re not doing this for the right person.”

…

Jonah: “Out of… _everyone_. Why is it me?”

Dani swallowed, feeling as if he was submerged entirely by the pervasive darkness around them. 

Dani: “What… do you mean? Like, show this spot…?”

Jonah: “No- Dani, please, just…”

He held out his arms in a wide shrug, then dropped them to his sides again with a clap against his jeans. 

Jonah: “You _know_ what I mean. It’s not… impossible to figure out.”

Jonah: “The sideways glances, the smiles that you only give me…” 

Jonah: “You were at your house when I sent that text, right? And how long did it take you? 10 minutes? If even that?”

Jonah: “A-And I appreciate it, I really do, but _why me?_” 

Dani said nothing. 

The crushing weight around him felt like he had been buried, every inch of his body pressed and cold. 

Thoughts hung breathless and dead and his mind, his eyes unfocused and blurred. But every quiet moment left Jonah to think more and more. 

Jonah: “Please…” 

Tears cut back down his face.

Jonah: “What is it that you see in me that I can’t see in myself! One good fucking thing!” 

Jonah: “Name one fucking thing I’ve achieved! One _good_ thing I’ve done!_ _If I hadn’t… she…”

He nearly buckled in on himself as he took in a racking breath.

Jonah: _“_I’ve ruined my fucking family- I’ve ruined this fucking night for you! What’s the point of me being here if all I do is **_fucking ruin everything?!?_”**

His breaths were feral now, uncontrolled rasps tearing into his chest. 

His eyes were hysterical, frenzied, his knees knocked into one another barely supporting him leaning against the hood of the car, cutting black in the headlight’s shine.

Jonah: “He was right! Dad was fucking right- what’s the point?!”

Jonah: “Everyone would be better off if **_I was just fucking dead!_**”

Dani lunged forward, panicking and unsure of what else to do, wrapping his arms around Jonah. 

In one jerked motion, Jonah retracted, coiled back his arm, hammered it forward. 

His fist caught just beneath Dani’s left eye and he stumbled, dazed, until his weight fell too far from his shuffling feet and he tipped hard onto his side, only cushioned by the grass and the damp soil. 

He rolled onto his back, gasping for the air that was pressed from his lungs on the impact. 

A menagerie of reactions and emotions and thoughts rumbled through his head, cacophonous enough to hear as a choir of ringing in his ears. 

Jonah: “A-Ah!”

Jonah: “S-sorry! I-I didn’t mean-” 

Jonah stammered, face mortified as he stared down at Dani, unflinching. 

He suddenly gripped his own wrist with his other arm, pulling it into his chest, but the expression he now wore was one of guilt, accompanied by a look that suggested he wasn’t the least bit surprised.

Jonah: “...”

Jonah “See?” 

He slid his back down the front of Dani’s car, leaned his head against the grill, staring blankly into the ocean of blackened trees before them. 

Jonah: “This is what I do.”

Dani- less steadily than he would have liked, the symphony of pathos still shaking his balance as it roared in his head- stood. 

He quickly swiped a clump of dirt that lodged itself onto his elbow. He looked down at the shriveled wolf below him, looking up at him with his sunken face and his dead eyes wordlessly.

He offered down a hand.

…

Dani: “Finish this at the spot? I think you’re gonna like it.”

Jonah stared up at the hand. Defeated, he sighed and dropped his gaze again. 

Jonah: “I don’t get it.”

Dani: “Because, Jonah. I want to try and show you who you really are. What you mean to me. No more hiding it. It’s not fair to you.”

Jonah sat for a moment, almost perfectly motionless. Finally, he glanced up once more, truly _seeing_ Dani this time. 

He wore no smile and his eye had begun to swell, the bottom lid already creeping further up near his golden iris. 

But his eyes were bright, his posture was unsteady, but not reduced. The hand he held out tremored slightly, but it held firm all the same. 

Dani: “Please, Jonah.”

Jonah took Dani’s hand. He used his free arm to wipe away at his puffy eyes, sniffing away at his clogged nose. Dani used his phone’s flashlight to light the path ahead of them. He didn’t let go of Jonah’s hand as they walked.

It was only a minute or two before they reached a parting in the trees, beyond which laid a bluff. Dani led Jonah up the knoll, trudging through the half-parted grass where he had tread before, before finally stopping at the top.

Before them was a small dropoff which fed into a perfectly stilled river. 

The water was glass, such a perfect reflection of the sky above that the only distinguishing feature between them was the mirrored image of the treeline opposite them cut into the edges, almost as if it were a world of its own hanging beneath the surface. 

A breeze carried through the ravine soundlessly rippling through the grass, waving planes of moonlight skating over the surface. The world around them held its breath- no sound beside their footsteps polluted their hearing. 

A lonesome tree only 10 or so feet away stood silent, even as the leaves bristled in the wind. 

Dani stopped and glanced to Jonah, smiling slightly as he saw the quiet wonder in Jonah’s eyes, staring up at the stars. 

He glanced down, only now realizing that their hands were still locked together.

Dani: “This is it… so…”

…

Dani: “Tah-tah…!”

Jonah: “How did you find this place?” 

All the fight in his voice was gone, leaving only wisped strands of vocalizations.

Dani: “Y’know… I actually don’t know. I just kinda… did. Must’ve pulled off the road at some point… I don’t know.”

Dani nodded to the ground, then lowered himself. Jonah slumped next to him; all the while, neither wanted to let the other’s hand free. 

Dani: “But I come here a lot when I need a way out, if I’m stressed, frustrated, need some space- whatever. ” 

Dani: “But… I don’t know.”

 

Dani: “I never feel… _alone_ out here, you know?”

Dani: “Like… I come here and no matter what, I feel like everything’ll be alright. I don’t know if it’s the sounds of the forest which…” 

Dani paused, letting his voice echo across the pool of cosmos before them. 

Dani: “...I guess decided to vanish for the night… but…”

Dani laid back, focusing on the miasma amongst the dark above. 

Dani: “It’s _my_ spot, y’know? I’ve never seen anyone else out here, and I don’t think I really want to.”

Jonah: “Then why did you bring me?”

Dani refocused back to his surroundings. Jonah was looking down at him, still sitting. He lifted his gaze back to the sky.

Dani: “Because I like you more than anyone else,” 

Jonah: “Why?”

Dani felt Jonah lay next to him. He could feel his warmth in the cool of the night, how he was so close their hoodies brushed at the shoulders.

Dan: “I don’t really know. I’ve never… _felt_ like this with anyone else before.”

Dani: “And I’m not gonna lie, it scares me a little because I’m always afraid I might lose you somehow. I always thought it was if I was too _much_, if I pushed you too far, if I was too… myself, I guess.”

Dani: “And so when I got that text…”

Dani: “Fuck man, it never even crossed my mind that it was a possibility.”

Dani: “But this time I knew that… y’know… there would be no coming back from it.”

Dani: “Sure you can stop talking to me, and _that_ scared me enough- but you being actually… _gone?_”

Dani sniffed, wiped away at the tears finally beginning to dam on his eyelids, only remembering he had been hit afterward as the dull throb roared into a flare of pain. He didn’t care much though.

Dani: “I don’t know why I like you so much over anyone else. Which… sounds bad I guess.”

Dani: “But some of the reasons I like you to begin with is because you’re kind… outspoken… just…”

Dani held his free hand up to the sky, staring at the grains of the feathers that clung to his knuckles. 

Dani: “You’re you. And you always care about everyone else. So much you forget to care about yourself.”

A silence hung between them for a moment. Dani could hear Jonah’s breath, the shifting of his head in the padded grass. 

Dani turned his head too, and Jonah’s eyes were on him. He was close- just a few inches. He could feel Jonah’s breath warming the tip of his beak.

Jonah: “And you took it on yourself to do it?” 

Dani: “You make it sound like an obligation… That’s the thing I don’t think you get. I _want_ to help you- I _want _to take care of you. Not out of some… sense of duty.”

Dani: “ You aren’t some…_ _helpless charity case Jonah. You’re not a burden.”

He glanced down to their hands, squeezed. He hadn’t realized how soft Jonah’s palm pads were… the way his hand’s fingertips had callused from playing bass.

Dani: “You matter to me. More than I think you could ever know- more than I could ever express with words.”

Dani: “I am always_- always_ here for you. And honestly, I’m scared for you. I just wish… someday… I just… 

Dani: “I hope you see yourself the way I see you. Because you deserve nothing less.”

Dani glanced back over to Jonah, his eyes still fixed on Dani. There was an intensity there that hadn’t been before. 

He was aware of every breath from his nares, the way it met with Jonah’s. His heart drummed slow, heavy; and in the moment, Dani felt weightless.

Dani: “Hey… Jonah?” 

Dani’s voice was different… somehow. It was a whisper, but there was a dull pang of something else, ringing from his numbed chest.

Jonah: “Yeah?” 

Dani turned onto his side towards Jonah. He stared into Jonah’s eyes with a near ferocious vigor.

Dani: “Swear to me. Swear that no matter what, no matter how bad things get, you won’t hurt yourself.”

…

Dani: “Please. I… I need you to promise.” 

Without thought, Dani’s palm found Jonah’s chin, his hand following the contour of his jaw. 

He wondered if Jonah could see the desperation within him. The hungry _need_ for reassurance. 

Jonah: “I promise...” 

In that moment, Dani initiated, pressing a slightly open beak around the end of Jonah’s maw.

It lasted only a moment, but it spread across the while like rain on windows.

Dani pulled back, his heart now hammering, his breath stilled completely.

But as he saw the look on Jonah’s face, his heart slowed, then stopped. 

The warmth that had been building within him flooded away all at once. 

Jonah’s face was flat again, his muzzle still slightly parted. 

He seemed… _confused._ No, not confused- he looked almost unnerved. 

Dani pulled away, his hand pulling from Jonah’s face slowly, tucking his arm into his chest. His eyes slipped down, finally breaking eye contact. 

Dani: “I-I’m sorry. I…”

Dani: “Fuck, Jonah. I’m sorry, I misread… a-and-”

Jonah: “No. You didn’t,” 

Dani’s eyes lifted again as Jonah whispered, just a prickle of warmth spreading from the center of his chest. 

Jonah: “Misread things, I mean.” 

The wolf let out a hearty sigh. 

Jonah:  “Dani, I _do_ like you but… I don’t know. I don’t think I’m ready for… anything, really, right now.” 

Jonah turned back again to look to the stars. 

Jonah: “I mean, I wasn’t even sure if I would make it this far into the night if I’m being honest.” 

The wolf let out something akin to a chuckle, but it was dry, joyless.

Dani still stared at the side of Jonah’s face, a dizzying relief crashing into him. He nodded, joining Jonah in looking at the stars. 

Jonah: “I-I just need some time I think.”

Dani: “I’ll be here. For however long it might take,” 

…

…

Jonah: “Dani?” 

Dani glanced to Jonah, barely moving his head. Jonah didn’t so much as turn his head, as if almost speaking to himself. 

Dani: “Yeah?” 

Jonah: “I don’t think I said thanks for coming for me earlier.” 

Jonah: “...”

Jonah: “Thank you.”

Dani’s cheeks lit ablaze and his sheepish grin shattered his facade of ‘quiet contemplation’.

Dani: “Always,” 

…

…

The rest of the night passed as a dream would. Just before they left, much later that night, Dani would carve into their tree “promise” with his pocket knife as a reminder for the both of them- that no matter what, neither of them was alone in their problems anymore.

Rather than the near tragedy of earlier that night- all they would remember from it was a promise made: and everything that it had started. And in a way, every time Dani now thinks back, how little it did.



**____________________________________________________________________________**

**ENDING = Take The Road Out of Town**

The two rode in silence as the night passed them by, the roads twisting and curving through the tree-dense hillside until eventually the winding road straightened and opened out into the world. 

The sky on this particular night was cloudless and moonless. Out here, away from any cities, the stars were free to flourish and painted the skies in swathes of blueish purple nebulas. 

By this point Dani’s playlist had run through completely, and new songs were beginning to take their turns creating ambience for the two of them.

Suddenly it occurred to Dani then that he had no idea where he was going. 

He’d simply started driving and ended up taking the road out of town without giving it much more thought. Plus, he’d been far too focused on his friend to think too much about something as trivial as the “where.” 

All that mattered was that they were here. 

Together.

Dani glanced at his friend. The wolf’s head was leaned back against the seat, tilted away from him to face the window, likely taking in the stars in a still silence. 

Just then, the screen of his phone lit up, flashing one of the many notifications that he tended to pay no mind to. But as his eyes looked to the screen, he managed to catch a glimpse of the time. 

_1:57?! Crap! Had he really been driving that long?_ 

Seeing the time and suddenly becoming conscious of how calm things were caused him to instinctively begin to open his beak for a wide yawn, but he quickly stopped himself and swallowed the yawn back down, not wanting to awaken the wolf Incase he had fallen asleep. 

Although, the twitching of Jonah’s ear followed by the slow turning of his head against the headrest towards him told Dani that Jonah had most definitely been awake.

Jonah: “Tired?” 

Hearing the wolf’s voice again after so long sent a wave of warmth through Dani that helped him snap out of his light highway hypnosis. 

Dani: “O-Oh! Only if you are.” 

Dani: “I can…” 

The yawn Dani had forced down suddenly returned with a vengeance, forcing his beak so wide that he could barely keep his eyes open. 

Dani: “Keep going all night…” 

Dani finally finishes the thought after a few seconds, then sighs. 

Dani: “Well, there goes my cool guy moment…”

Jonah rolls his eyes, grinning playfully. 

Jonah: “And you were so close too.” 

Dani: “Well now I’ve gotta think of something else cool to say.”

Jonah: “Heh, well no need to rush, you’ve got plenty of time.” 

Jonah inhaled sharply after he finished speaking, which led to a long, wide yawn of his own. The following exhale was low and slow as he sunk back into his chair. 

Jonah: “It’s really nice out tonight.”

Dani: “Yeah, right? We got pretty lucky with the weather.” 

Dani: “I mean, imagine if it was raining or something.”

Jonah: “I don’t even wanna…” 

Jonah’s voice trailed off as the two sat in silence again. 

But after some moments, Dani heard shifting in the seat beside him and turned to find Jonah looking right at him. 

Jonah: “Are you going to ask?” 

Dani: “Huh?”

Jonah: “About what happened tonight.”

Dani: “Oh…” 

Dani paused, the question catching him by surprise. 

Dani: “I… wasn’t really going to.”

Dani: “I didn’t know if you wanted to talk about it or not. And making sure you were okay… mattered more to me than knowing, I guess. I mean… it still does.”

 Although he didn’t turn to look at Jonah, he could see the wolf’s soft smile out of the corner of his eye. 

Jonah: “You’re a good friend, Dani.”

Dani’s heart began to flutter in his chest. He had to restrain himself from allowing his leg to start bouncing, and suddenly the indie rock song that had been playing absently in the background started to sound really really good. 

Jonah: “I-”

Jonah stops, even without turning his head, Dani could even see the fur on Jonah’s body visibly stand on end, and even without turning his head, Dani immediately knew something was wrong. 

Jonah’s arms were stretched out, one reaching for the side of Dani’s seat while the other braced the inside of the door, feet pressed to the floor of the car as if attempting to brace himself for a sudden impact. 

His breaths had picked up again and Dani could see his chest beginning to rise and fall rapidly. But the thing that truly made Dani’s heart skip a beat were the wolf’s eyes. 

They were wide,

_terrified_. 

A shiver ran through Dani as his eyes darted back to the road in an instant, following Jonah’s gaze. But other than the wide field, night sky and open road, there was nothing there.

Jonah: “No…” 

Dani: “W-what? Are you alright?”

Jonah: “S-stop the car.”

Dani: “Is there something out there…? I don’t see any-”

Jonah: “Stop the car!” 

The tires of Dani’s car screeched, skidding across the road as Dani slammed his foot on the break at the sound of Jonah’s cry. 

The moment the car jolted to a full stop, Dani found himself turning towards Jonah, thoughts rushing through his head as his body seemed to move on its own. 

_What happened? Is he hurt? Did he see something? _

Dani quickly scanned his surroundings, but seeing nothing yet again his eyes darted back to Jonah to check more thoroughly for some kind of injury. But the wolf was struggling frantically in his seat, no longer looking out the window as he had moments before. 

A quick glimpse at the side of Jonah’s face was more than enough to see the trail of blood that was starting to stain the wolf’s fur just below his nose. 

Dani opened his mouth to speak again, but the sudden sound of a click interrupted him before he could start. One of Jonah’s arms reached forward, and the next thing Dani knew, the wolf had already bolted out across the road. 

Dani: “...”

Dani: “...Oh Shit!” 

Dani lurched forward, but didn’t get far as his own seat belt pulled him back. 

_Shit!_

Dani’s eyes locked onto Jonah’s back as his friend sprinted out across the road, hands pinning his ears to the side of his head. 

Dani: “Jonah! Wait! Where are you going?!”

Dani: “Come back!”

Dani’s arms bolted for his own seatbelt, but his shaky hands were working against him, taking him a few more moments than he ideally would have liked to feel his way towards unbuckling the belt. 

By the time he managed to undo his belt and open his door, the wolf was already starting to shrink into a speck in the night. 

Dani: “Oh fuck…”

It was only now as he stood in the cool night air that he felt his heart hammering against the inside of his chest, and how cool and crisp the air truly was against his skin and lungs. 

The next thing Dani knew, he had crossed the road as well, full sprinting with his eyes only focused on not losing sight of one thing. 

Just as Dani’s foot left the pavement and touched down into the grass beside the road, one of the lights overhead began to flicker. 

___________________________________________

It wasn’t supposed to be here, not now. 

It wasn’t supposed to come back. It couldn’t come back, his father had assured him of that. And yet, here he was, running for his life. 

He knew he was going to die the moment he heard it again, but that part didn’t matter. He had half been planning to die tonight anyway, he hadn’t cared much about the particular method.

_But not now… not right now… not with him…_

The breeze felt as if it had surged into a roaring tempest against him. The stars glittered and swirled above head, twisting the light of the distant nebula’s into unsettling spirals of vibrant blueish pinks that made Jonah want to hurl. 

A sickly, metallic scent overpowered his nose and he could feel the warm blood pooling in the back of his throat.

He glanced behind him, the road was now a distant string only even noticeable due to illumination from the roadside lights hanging down overhead. 

And there in the lane farthest from him was Dani’s car, the door he had sprinted out of lingering open as the light from the open vehicle shone dimly onto the road. 

He didn’t care if he died anymore. At this point he was convinced that he would have deserved it, but not Dani. _Not him_. 

Jonah closed his eyes, clenching out a new batch of tears. 

After everything that had happened, this was inevitable. He knew that now, but he could still fight for Dani. _He could still run_. He could still be alone once it found him so that he would be the only one to die. 

The trembling came first, barely audible over the sound of Jonah’s own frantic breaths as he ran. Even from a distance, the noise was incessant, rattling his skull from within.

But within moments, it began to draw closer, louder, as the earth rumbled, and Jonah knew it must have seen him. 

He felt his muzzle open, he felt himself scream as his skull trembled from within, but even his own shriek was drowned out be the sound of the encroaching, incessant noise that threatened to make his head burst from the inside out. 

He reached out with an arm, swinging wildly, violently, thrashing out at anything in the hopes that he would hit something and make it stop. 

But instead of his arm, Jonah felt his foot slam into something hard and cold and his shoulder slammed down into the dirt as he tumbled over. Needles of pain shot through foot and knee, but those paled in comparison to the pain that ravaged his shoulder. 

He wailed into the air, but again the sound did not reach his own ears. He clawed at the dirt, pulling himself onto his knees with the only arm he could still feel and scrambling to his feet. 

He tried to run, but the quaking of the earth made it impossible to find a new balance and Jonah stumbled over to his side, almost falling back onto his shoulder again, but instead managing to only fall to his knees, panting. 

His vision blurred as he pushed himself up, his hands clutched at his rattling skull as the world’s color crumbled around him. 

And then, that’s when he heard the knocking. 

Even out in the open field, It came from all around, from everywhere, all at once, summoning the nebulas in the sky to spiral down towards him.

A pair of arms wrapped around Jonah’s back. 

It was here. It had found him. 

Despite knowing what came next, Jonah’s arm swung with all the might he could muster. 

___________________________________________

Dani lunged forward, panicking and unsure of what else to do, wrapping his arms around Jonah, the next moment, a furry fist slammed into his cheek, just below his left eye. 

His vision skipped as he stumbled backward, dazed, until his weight fell too far from his side-stepping feet and he tumbled hard into his side, only cushioned by the grass and the damp soil. 

He rolled onto his back, gasping for the air that was pressed from his lungs on the impact. A menagerie of reactions and emotions and thoughts rumbled through his head, loud enough to hear as a choir of ringing in his ears. 

He looked up to Jonah who was now near motionless, eyes still wide with one hand curled into the shape of a fist as he stood, nose still bloodied and panting wildly in the starlight.

Dani: “Oh… Fuuuuuuck…” 

Dani’s head was still spinning a little from the sudden, unexpected blow. But he managed to reorient himself enough to sit up and meet Jonah’s eyes, which were wide still, with fear. 

Likely from whatever it was that had spooked him. But there was something else there now too… _confusion_?

The wolf looked around sharply, anxiously, as if searching for something nearby. Dani noticed his eyes occasionally darting up towards the sky only to instantly shoot back down towards the ground. 

Jonah: “Wh-where did it go?!”

Dani: “What?!? A-Are you okay?!”

Dani: “Was there… something out here?” 

But the questions fell on deaf ears as Jonah’s eyes continued to dart around like Dani wasn’t even there. 

Dani: “Jonah, talk to me, please!” 

The wolf’s ears twitched at the sound of his name as his head finally turned back to Dani. 

Jonah: “…D-Dani?” 

Jonah: “…”

The maddened look in Jonah’s his eyes started to fade.

Jonah: “I-I’m sorry… I-I didn’t mean to…”

Dani: “It’s cool… you’re… you’re good. Ugh…”

Dani groaned while massaging his stinging cheek gently. 

Dani: “With reflexes like that, I’m not so worried about your survival instincts anymore…” 

Dani chuckled lightly, but looking at the wolf again he sensed that something was wrong again before it even happened. 

And a moment after the feeling passed, the wolf covered his tear-ridden face in his paws. 

Jonah: “It’s… it’s all my fault…” 

Dani: “H-hey…”

Jonah: “It’s all my fault, it’s all my fault, it’s all my fault…” 

Each time he uttered the phrase he sounded more and more choked than the last. 

The wolf pulled his hands away from his face, fingers slightly curled as he stared at them, eyes wide and with a wild look that made Dani shudder. 

Then Jonah clutched at the fur on his forehead so hard that Dani winced at the thought that he might tear some out. 

And that’s when Jonah started laughing. 

Jonah: “I… I really am the worst…”

Jonah: “I-I’m so fucked I even thought that _thing_ was here...”

Jonah: “But of course it isn’t. It can’t be back. I’m just loosing my fucking mind!”

Jonah screamed the words up at the sky, to the stars. 

Jonah: “Because all I can ever do is ruin things! My family! My life! This fucking night!”

Jonah: “There’s no point in fucking living anymore if all I’m going to do is **ruin things forever!**” 

Jonah’s head fell down away from the sky, eyes to the ground as the wolf’s arms suddenly both fell limp at his sides 

Jonah: “This is my life now… This is what I am…”

Jonah: “All I can do is run away and hurt people who care about me!”

Jonah: “He was right! _He was right_! There’s no fucking point anymore! I’d just be doing everyone else a favor-“

Dani: “JONAH!” 

Dani’s head was still pounding, but he knew he had heard enough.

Jonah visibly flinched at the sound of his name. But at that, the bird almost wanted to smile at the slight hint of his friend returning from this madness that had been invading him. 

He didn’t smile though, instead steeling himself before rising back onto his feet as he once again became conscious of his own heartbeat that he could feel pounding out of his chest. 

He looked at the terrified wolf. The tears clouding Jonah’s eyes almost seemed to make them sparkle under the starlight, and for a moment, Dani wondered whether or not he was truly imagining just how brilliantly they seemed to glisten. 

Dani: “Can I…” 

Dani: “Can I hug you, Jonah?”

Jonah: “Wh-what?” 

	

Dani paused, looking down at the grass between his feet as the beat of his heart synchronized with their sway. 

Dani: “If… If I’m being completely honest… This whole night has been terrifying.”

Dani: “First there was the message and not knowing whether or not you were okay… then going one hundred plus in a residential area…” 

Dani: “Things got a lot better once I found you though.”

Dani: “I-I was still worried, but once we were together, at least I knew you were safe, and that whatever you were going through I could do my best to be there for you.” 

Dani: “But… even with all that, the scariest thing I’ve seen all night was you just now, running off into the night… alone…”

Jonah: “Scary?” 

The wolf laughed again 

Jonah: “Hell yeah I’m scary! Fucking look at me! I’m going insane!”

Dani: “No.” 

Dani: “You’re not… you’re not scary, Jonah.”

Dani: “You’re kind… you’re funny… you’re creative and you’re loving.” 

Dani: “You’re the reason I’m out in the middle of nowhere, rolling around in the dirt at two in the morning.”

Jonah: “Yeah… because I started freaking out and roped you into this stupid fucking stunt of mine!”

Jonah: “No one should have to deal with this bullshit! It’s not fucking worth it!”

Dani: “It is to me.”

The wolf paused as his ears twitched at the words. He inhaled, muzzle opening to speak… but no words came out. 

Dani: “I know you’re going through a lot right now. I know that it must hurt… _so _fucking much.”

Dani: “And it scares me to see you hurting like this.”

Dani: “But the thing that scares me more… is the thought of losing you to it.” 

Dani felt his body growing warm as the words he felt flowed out of him one after the other. 

His eyes so focused on the wolf that he barely noticed the tears pooling within them. 

Dani: “That’s why I came, and that’s why I ran after you. Because the thought of that image I had in my mind… of you running away from everything, alone…”

Dani: “The thought of that possibly being the last time I might ever see you again was…” 

Dani felt them now though, the tears that streamed down the feathers on his face as his own floodgates fell open and his heart poured out into the night. 

And yet, he couldn’t help but smile at his friend.

Dani: “And that’s why… it’s why I’m crying right now.” 

Dani: “Because I’m so happy to see that you’re still here… that I didn’t lose you… to… _this_…” 

Dani spread his arms, gesturing to the world around them. 

Dani: “I need you to know that you’re not a burden, Jonah. You’re not.”

Dani: “You deserve so much more than that, and I really hope… I just really hope that one day you’ll see that the same way I do.”

Dani rubbed his eyes as the wolf sniffled, the corners of Jonah’s muzzle twitching to betray the insistence he had tried to wear on his sleeve. 

Dani: “Please, I just… please. Promise me that no matter how much it hurts… promise me that you won’t hurt yourself, Jonah.”

Dani: “Because that… that would hurt me more than any punch ever could.”

…

…

Jonah: “I-I…

Jonah: “I…” 

Dani watched, eyes wide as the wolf’s voice trembled. 

All he’d wanted was for it to have been enough. That what he felt in his heart could be enough to save his friend. 

The wolf opened his mouth again as if to speak, only to press his face into his paws and begin to bawl. 

But this time, there were no words of despair or anguish. No reasons why he’d deserved this pain. These tears were pure, free from self hatred, and one with his true heart. 

Dani stepped towards the wolf and wrapped his arms around him tightly. Jonah’s fur was soft, and his body was warm, 

Smelling faintly of citrus.

He felt the wolf’s chest and heart beating as he cried and as he breathed. 

Jonah: “I promise…” 

Jonah: “I promise…”

…

Dani: “Thank you.”

Dani: “That’s all I needed to hear…”

…

The two held the hug until the wolf’s cries eventually waned into faint wimpers, and finally until all tears were shed, and the only sound heard between the two of them was the occasional sniffle. 

…

…

Dani: “Hey, Jonah?”

Jonah: “Y-yeah?”

Dani: “Do you want to get some food with me?” 

Dani: “I know a decent pancake place that might still be open.” 

There was a pause. Then, Dani felt the wolf’s grip loosen as Jonah pulled back from the hug, sniffling once more and freeing his arms to wipe his eyes as his muzzle widened into the form of a smile. 

Jonah: “Yeah.” 

Jonah: “I’d love to.”
