**Scene 1 (Argument between Jonah and his dad):**

His phone occasionally buzzed gently on the carpeted floor, but as the day went on the sounds grew sparse until they eventually stopped. 

Jonah knew that they meant well, but he couldn’t talk to them. He didn’t want them to see him like this, and it’s not like he would have known what to say.

So instead he lied on the couch and buried his face in a pillow, sobbing gently. 

He hadn’t noticed as the hours passed and day turned to night. 

Or rather he hadn’t cared.

Jonah flinched at the sound of the front door unlocking as it killed the silence around him, but he didn’t move at all.

With a final click, the last of the door’s locks were undone as the front door slowly swung open, followed by the sound of it quickly closing and its locks being flicked shut. 

Then a pair of footsteps entered the house, and as they did Jonah’s eyes finally opened, glancing over to see a large fox standing in the doorway to the living room. 

His father. 

The two locked eyes for only a moment, but no words were exchanged between them. Then, the fox’s eyes turned elsewhere as he marched throughout the rest of the house. 

Words and emotions that had since fallen to rest in Jonah’s mind began to stir once more at the sight of his father. 

He forced his eyes closed, trying to suppress them once more, but all he could hear were the sound of footsteps echoing on the hardwood floors above, accompanied by the sounds of slamming drawers. 

Eventually the noises stopped, and Jonah heard the footsteps heading back down the stairs. 

They traveled down the hall, towards him, and Jonah caught another glimpse of the fox as he walked past the door frame to the living room a second time. 

But this time, the fox did not look to Jonah, and the sound of the locks on the front door began to flick open once again. 

Jonah: “You’re… just going to leave again?”

The fox’s ear twitches, but the clicking of the locks continues until the last one comes undone. 

Jonah clenches a fist at the sound of the door creaking open, suddenly finding himself now sitting up on the couch. 

Jonah: “DAD!”

The sounds of the door and the footsteps pause at once as the fox stands under the arch of the front door, looking out into the night. 

He does not turn his head. 



??: “What?”




Jonah: “So that’s it? You’re just gonna come back after a week and leave again without saying anything at all?!”



??: “What is there to say?”





Jonah: “Oh, I don’t know! How about where the hell you’ve even been for starters?!”



??: “...”
??: “That’s confidential-”






Jonah: “No! Dad no! You don’t get to just say that! You can’t just fucking say that to me anymore!”



??: “...”





Jonah’s father sighs heavily through his nose. He  closes back the door and turns from the doorway to face Jonah, leaning against the doorframe to the living room with his arms crossed.  



??: “You want to talk, Jonah? Fine, whatever you’ve got to say, go on and spit it out.”
??: “But you’re gonna talk to me like a man. Start crying again and I’m walking right back out that door.”


Jonah: “...”

Jonah: “Mom’s… Mom’s gone… and you’ve just been running around this whole time like nothing ever happened.”



??: “You think I don’t know that? It's a waste of time to sit around on my ass like you’ve been doing.”
??: “Is that all you’ve got to say to me?”





Jonah: “...”

Jonah: “Where have you been, dad?”



??: “...”


Jonah: “...”

Jonah: “Why… why aren’t you answering me?”



??: “Because you’re clearly not ready to carry your own weight in this. So naturally that means it's my job to pick up the slack.”





Jonah’s face twitches, and then suddenly he is on his feet. 

Jonah: “What slack?!”

Jonah: “What the hell are you talking about, dad?!”

Jonah: “All you do is say these cryptic things about fighting back and staying alive, but you never fucking explain any of it!"

Jonah: “Just fucking tell me where you were so that I can understand something! Anything! Please!”



??: “...”
??: “I can’t.”
??: “Trust me, it's better this way.”




Jonah: “...”



??: “Isn’t that what a parent is supposed to do? Provide? Protect their-”




Jonah: “No! Dad! You’re not _listening_ to me! I don’t want to be protected! I don’t care about that!”



??: “You know, I really don’t fucking understand you, Jonah.”
??: “What is it that you actually want here?”






Jonah: “YOU! DAD!”



??: “...”






Jonah: “I… I just want you to be here…”



??: “...”





Jonah: “Please… I-I… I’m scared…”

Jonah: “I… I don't want to lose you too…” 



??: “...”
??: “...”
??: “And you think that gives you any say in how I spend the time I’ve got left?”
??: “Need I remind you whose fault it is that we’re in this situation to begin with?”





Jonah: “...”



??: “Oh please, don’t give me that fucking look. You know exactly what I’m talking about.”
??: “_You_ killed her. Chira died because of **_you_.**”






Jonah: “N-No! No! How could you say that?! I-I told you I was trying to help!”



??: “Trying, sure. You might have been trying.”
??: “But take a look around you, you think it matters what you were _trying_ to do?!”
??: “You fucked up!”



Jonah: “N-no…”



??: “Hell, it’s only thanks to me you’re still here right now instead of locked up in some crack-house prison for the fucking deranged, you know that?!”
??: “You think I enjoyed having to hide her fucking body because of the mistake _you_ made?! You think that was a **_fun_** experience for me, Jonah?!”




Jonah: “Stop!”



??: “And then you have the fuckin nerve to complain to **_me_** about how _lonely_ it is here!”
??: “Maybe you should have fuckin thought of that before you pulled the goddamn trigger!”



Jonah: “STOP IT!-“

Dad: “NO! YOU YOU’RE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO TALK! SO NOW YOU’RE GONNA FUCKING HEAR THIS!”

The shouts ended just as sharply as they began. 

By the time they were over, Jonah had crumbled to the floor, eyes wide and breaths labored as his hands twitched uncontrollably as if struggling to grip an object. 



??: “You interfered when you weren’t fucking supposed to!”
??: “I had everything under control! I was finally going to free us from that… _fucking creature_!”
??: “I just needed her suggestible… and you… you…”
??: “What the fuck were you thinking?!”
??: “…”




His father’s head turned away, gazing up at the starry sky through the arched window just above the front door. 

He didn’t notice the sounds of his son’s quiet sobs as he continued to mutter to himself. 



??: “All your life I’d been wanting to teach you to shoot so that you could protect this family if something ever happened to me.”
??: “Tch.”
??: “How ironic that the first time you’d ever shoot something it’d be her.”
??: “But I guess that’s just what I fuckin deserve after all this, ain’t it?”
??: “…”
??: “Although, I guess none of that matters anymore...”
??: “She’s gone now. There ain’t no one to blame for that but _you_.”



Jonah’s father froze as he turned back to his son to find him on his knees, face pressed into his hands. His eyes narrowed at the small dark circles that now stained the front of Jonah’s hoodie. 



??: “Oh for god’s sake, what the fuck did I tell you about crying in front of me?!”



There was no response. 



??: “You already know how bad you fucked up, so I ain’t gonna say it again.”

He turned to the door once more, unfolding his arms as his weight shifted back onto his feet.



??: “What I will say is that you’ve always been soft, Jonah. People like you aren’t built to bear these kinds of burdens.”
??: “But despite everything that’s happened, you’re still my son. I love you, and I don’t want you to suffer more than you need to.”
??: “That’s why I wouldn’t blame you if you offed yourself tonight.”
??: “There’s a debit card and some cash on the table upstairs. Use that to keep yourself alive if you want. Or don’t.”
??: “If it runs out before I see you again then go make yourself useful to someone and get a real job.”


Jonah: “...”


??: “Now I’m going out, got some more stuff I need to take care of. Doubt I’ll be back here for a while.”
??: “If you do go through with it just don’t make a mess in the house.”
??: “…”
??: “Goodbye, son.”


The front door closed and its locks clicked shut. 

The only other sound to be heard was that of a motor, and a car pulling out of the driveway.
